Display mode switcher to native Retina (2880x1800) for Retina MBP.

This project and code are public domain.  You may do with them what you wish.

It is very, very, very simple - if your main display supports the Retina resolution, it
is immediately switched to that resolution.  Otherwise, nothing happens.

To reverse this, simply go to System Configuration > Displays and reset the resolution.

I am publishing this utility in this format because I was a little hesitant to install
anything just to reset my screen resolution.

Resolution change persists through reboot and logout.  I have not tested this or any
other odd corner cases.  Use is at your own risk, but as you can see from the code, there's
not a hell of a lot that can go wrong.

Please mail corrections, suggestions or questions to greg@desult.com.  I am not an OS X
expert, so I may be doing something wrong here.
